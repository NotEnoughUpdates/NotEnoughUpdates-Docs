## 2.0 Prerelease 24.4 - 02/28/2021

### Added

* Fixed pet overlay not working with high level / maxed pets \(hypixel, why is '1k' lowercase and '1M' uppercase?\)
* fixed crash with /pv



## 2.0 Prerelease 24.2 - 02/25/2021

### Changed

* Xp/h of pet overlay excludes greatest \(if you get 500k mining xp it doesn't say 859m XP/h\)
* Pet overlay no longer uses API, uses /pets menu instead. Should make the XP numbers more accurate. If something goes wrong, you should be able to fix it by revisiting all pages of /pets
