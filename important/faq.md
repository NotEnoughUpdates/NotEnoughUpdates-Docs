1.8.9

## Can it be added/used with BLC/Lunar clients?

Yes/No, BLC have made their own version of the mod with only like 2 features.

## Why is the NeuAH, Profile Viewer, or Dungeon Profit not working?

 Make sure you have your api key set by either entering it manually or doing `/api new`. If it still not working after having your api key set ask in \#neu-support-1 or \#neu-support-2.

##  Why does running `/neu` just open my inventory?

This is due to Hypixel changing their server brand, which allows the mod to detect if it is on Skyblock. To fix this please download the latest version of the mod in \#neu-updates or \#neu-prereleases.
